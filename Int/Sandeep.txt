Q1: Given list of words return true if there is any prefix exists; these words are sorted in descending order of length.


ex: abcdefg

      bhjef

      kjlm

      abc

      xy


return true since abc is prefix of abcdefg if abc doesn’t exist in above list then return false


Write a password generating function.


Given a length generate a password according to the rules.


Rules :


1) Min Length of the password is 3

2) Max Length is 72

3) It must have at least one CAPITAL, one NUMERIC and one SPECIAL character

4) No character must repeat 3 times, that is AA is valid in the password, but AAA is not. AeA


Here are the character sets


CAPITAL = A-Z;

SMALL = a-z;

SPECIAL = ~,!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,)

NUMERIC = 0-9;


Please assume all helper functions that you need exists, for example, getRandomSmall or getRandomSpecial or feel free to make up

functions that you need.


Please also remember that the intend of this question is to be a conversation starter. We are more interested in seeing how you think and we would also like to see some sample of your code.

Microsoft Onsite interview:


Interviews will be organized as 10 mins of intro and about your work, one simple design question on distributed systems/scalability/concurrency and finally one coding questions with 20-25 mins given.

1.Find longest span of an array where a[i]=a[j] and |i-j| = maximum value


a.example 1,2,3,0,1,2,3,1,3,2,0,0,0,2 -> in this case we have to return index 1 (which is array[1] = 2 and last index since i-j is maximum here), 


b.Use map key as element and keep updating second index , and this can be done in single pass - > map<int, pair<int,int>> -> initially set pair<int,int> to same indices and if element found in map just update it.


2.Semaphores -> Producer and Consumer problem, have implement complete class for rounded buffer ( queue ) and performed enqueue & dequeue operations as multi threaded safe


3.In 1..n elements one element is replaced with zero, find missing element - this is simple problem of xor or sum of n elements and sum of given array.


4.Designing a cache to support based on some specific requirements


5.Design problem on Azure compute to optimize resource utilization


6.Design problem on Azure compute to optimize some deployment services


7.One coding question related to above design.

Oracle Onsite Interview: 

Total 5 Rounds:

1.Two Questions - 60% of time around Design questions and 40% time around coding questions.


a.Talk about distributed systems, your current work - Questions around the design.


b.Given a dictionary sorted in lexicographical order (can be any dictionary not just english) you have to return all characters appeared lexicographically. It may have holes in the dictionary


    Example:

        Apple

        Apricot

        Ball

        Bat

        ..

        …

        Zoo return {a, b, ..z}


2.Lunch interview with Manager - Cultural Fit around and design URL shortening service..


3.Coding Question only , no design question.


a.Consider Image as below 


Class Image {

        Int width;

        Int height;

        Void SetPixel(int x, int y, Pixel& p);

        Pixel& GetPixel(int x, int y)

}; 


So it  is represented as 2D matrix, and how do you implement a function to draw a line between two points as by setting color to given pixel.

This should not draw as some zig zag pattern, line should like approximately like a straight line.

Void DrawLine(Image& image, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, Pixel& p) 

4.Coding and Design 


a.Talk about your current work and problems around distributed systems.


b.Given a tree with extra point “next”, populate sibling pointers with this next, very standard interview question


5.Final round - Only coding question - Given a rational number represent its decimal expression  in string format


a.Struct rationalNumber {


            Int a;

            Int b;

        };


        std::string DecimalExpression(rationalNumber& r) {

        }

        Example given rationalNumber {2, 10} = 2/10 so your function should return “0.2”

    If {1, 3} is given you should return 0.(3) -> As three repeats for {1. 6} it should be “0.1(6)”

Expectation is do integer arithmetic step by step and construct the string.

Given UserId and Cost find average of topK elements cost








FB
 
 

 



 

 
1. validation of a binary tree - the input is a binary tree - can be unbalanced, filled with integers. The objective is to give an output true/false based on the following condition - every integer in the left subtree should be less than equal to the node and every integer in the right subtree should be greater than equal to the current node.
 

 



 

 
2. Name tagging. Given a scenario like in facebook where there is a friend list for every account, we have to identify friends names from a message. eg. given I have in my friends list {"Mark Daniel", "Jason Rupert", "Mark Day", "Steve Martin"}, and the message is "Mark Daniel says hi to Jason Rupert", the output should be {0: "Mark Daniel", 23: "Jason Rupert"}
 

 



 

 
3. Matrix word search. given a rectangular grid of letters and a word, a true/false result has to be given to indicate whether the word can be formed by tracing a random walk on the square grid with step size one and no revisiting of cells.
 

 
eg,
 

 
a d k a g
 

 
a f i k a
 

 
e r n e t
 

 



 

 
and word "fine" should return true.
 

 



 

 
4. Minesweeper grid generator
 

 
write an algo to generate a random minesweeper grid with 1 for mined and 0 for no mine. the only inputs are the grid size and number of mines.
 

 



 

 
5. Imagine that you are an software engineer and a Program Manager has asked you to write a class or classes to back a UI control. So, the UI control looks something like a multi-state tree control: every node may have multiple children, and each node can be in a checked state, in which case all if it's children are also checked, or unchecked, in which case all of it's children are also unchecked. However, if the node has both checked and unchecked children, then it's in a "mixed" state.
 

 
 

 
A [M]
 

 
 D [ ]
 

 
 E [X]
 

 
   F [X]
 

 
B [ ]
 

 
C [ ]
 

 
  G [ ]
 

 
  E [ ]
 

 
    H [ ]
 

 



 

 
Once you write the class, write a method to 'set' the state of a node.

3. Design a maze with entry and exit. Write a method to say if there is a path from entry to exit.
 

 



 

 
4. Given a 2-D array (represented as a 1-d array and the number of columns), find the sum of all elements from the first element (top left corner) to the current element. Do it for all elements in the array.
 

 
  Solution: Dynamic Programming with O(width) storage
 

 



 

 
5. Given a ambiguous input how many ways can you parse. No need for all the possibilities, just the number of ways.
 

 
  The problem boils down to using DP. No need for recursion to generate all possibilities.
 

 
  eg: Morse code. The English alphabet is represented with "." and "-" with each character represented between 1 and 4 morse chars
 

 
  There are multiple ways to parse an incoming morse code. Find the total number of ways.

  Given: List of cities where a company is based, and for each city the number of holidays during each week in a year
 

 
  Objective: Maximize the number of holidays an employee can get by judiciously traveling between the different locations
 

 
  Constraints:
 

 
   -> Fly on weekends (at most can go to only one other city)
 

 
   -> weekends are holidays everywhere.
 

 
   -> direct flight exists for all cases.
 

 
   -> can only travel to another city when the flight duration <=7 hrs (implies: missing edges)

1. Rolling lists example:
 

 
  struct Node {
 

 
  int count;
 

 
  int buffer[MAX_SIZE];
 

 
  Node* next;
 

 
  };
 

 

 

 
  MAX_SIZE is 4 and count indicates number of existing elements in the node, ex: [10, 20, 30, 40, -6, -8, 12] array can be reprasented as rolling list node1, node2, node3, node1 = [count = 2 buffer[] = {10, 20}, next = node2} so on.. Implement int Get(int index) and void Insert(int index, int value) - Insert function should move elements if given slot is already full. example Get(4) should return -6, Insert(5, 20) should push elements in rolling list.
 

 

 

 
2. stuct List {
 

 
    int startTimeSlot;
 

 
    int endTimeSlot;
 

 
    int memoryUtilizaton;
 

 
    };
 

 
    Given List<Request> write a function to return maximum utilization point. Ex - R1 = { T1, T2, 10} R2 = {T2, T4, 30} R3= {{T3, T4, 20} - max utilizatoin here is at T3 30 + 20; at T4 it is 0, at T1 it is 10, at T2 it is 30 - 10 = 20;
