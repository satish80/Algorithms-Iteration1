Problems:
	1) Design a car FM station to store the FM frequencies into channels with best signal strengths 
	2) Design an elevator system  (2 elevators) with floors served upto 10
	3) Design a Reader Writer Lock to allow many threads to read the value of a property, but only one can write at a time (semaphores can be used to achieve)
	4) Design a Maze (hint: n * n matrix with a recursion to reach the destination )
	5) Design a SuDoKu
	6) Find the least denomination for a given number (within 1, 2,5 ). Eg: Rs 10 can be denominated as 5+5 and 3 can be 1 +2 with the values given
	7) 
	

Arrays:
	1) Identify median of sorted array
	2) Print the ascending order / median / minimum of sorted rotated array (6 7 1 2 3 4 5)
	3) Remove duplicates from an array (2 3 6 2 5 3)
	4) Shuffle cards (use Random number generation)
	5) Array to Binary search tree
	
Integer related:

	1) Prime numbers between a range
	
Data structures Problems: Integers, Linked lists, Stacks, Queues:
	1) Quick sort
	2) Heap sort
	3) Merge sort
	4) Bubble sort
	5) Radix sort
	6) Reverse a stack
	
Trees:
	1) Search for a value in a Binary search tree
   2)  Insert  / delete a value to/from a binary search tree
	3) Mirror the values of a binary tree (the values of left and right should be swapped)
	4) InOrder / Preorder/ PostOrder/ LevelOrder/ Reverse LevelOrder traversals
	5) Height of a tree
	6) Is tree a Binary search tree?
	7) Find Ancestors of a node in a tree
	8) Reverse a tree (Leaf nodes would be the root nodes and the child nodes of root node would be parent of root node and so on..)
